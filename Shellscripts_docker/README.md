### 1. Organize Your Repository:

Ensure that your GitHub repository is organized with the necessary files. For example:

- **Dockerfile:** Contains instructions to build your Docker image.
- **docker-scripts:** Directory containing your Docker shell scripts.
- **azure-scripts:** Directory containing your Azure shell scripts.
- **README.md:** Documentation for your repository.

### 2. Document the Project Structure:

In your `README.md` file, describe the project structure and the purpose of each directory. For example:

```
## Project Structure

- **docker-scripts:** Contains shell scripts for Docker-related tasks.
- **azure-scripts:** Contains shell scripts for Azure-related tasks.
- **Dockerfile:** Instructions for building the Docker image.
- **README.md:** Documentation for running scripts and managing the project.
```

### 3. Instructions for Running Docker Scripts:

#### Docker-related tasks:

Include a section explaining how to run Docker scripts. For example:

```
## Running Docker Scripts

1. Navigate to the `docker-scripts` directory:

   ```
   cd docker-scripts
   ```
```
2. ## Execute a Docker script using the following command:

```

```
./script_name.sh
```

   Replace `script_name.sh` with the name of the specific Docker script you want to run


```
## Troubleshooting

- **Problem:** Unable to run Docker scripts.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that Docker is installed and the scripts have the correct permissions.

- **Problem:** Azure script fails to execute.
  - **Solution:** Double-check Azure CLI installation and verify Azure authentication.
```


```
